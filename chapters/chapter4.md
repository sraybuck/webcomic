- the previously unseen confrontation in the Ark in its entirety
    - Audrey confronts Mathias about the documents
    - Mathias fully brings her into the know on the plan
    - Audrey says she wont do it, that hes crazy, this is innocent people, and he's misconstruing all the teachings of Lathander

    - thats where the prologue picks up
