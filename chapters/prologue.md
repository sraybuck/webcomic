title: "Prologue: The Cult"
dark: true

It had been about twenty minutes after Sarin decided cult life wasn't for him when a ball of holy fire exploded right over his head. 

He had spent a while deliberating and he decided that while he did indisputably owe the people of Lathander's Light his life, it just really wasn't working out. His main line of work was stealing, which wasn't very viable in an austere cult complex in the middle of the wasteland. As a trained criminal, the stark rooms of simple furniture and the ban on personal adornment left him almost itching for a wide thoroughfare of Chantelle, full of highly accessorized ladies and unobservant men. Additionally, Sarin was a pretty social person. While not exactly the most well-liked individual, there was something to be said for a nice evening out with some of the boys from the crew. That and However, most of his attempts here to joke around and get other cultists to open up had failed. While pretty much everyone was very polite, very few people enjoyed his go-to joke about dragon testicles. The only person he could really get to talk to him was that one redheaded teen that always hung around the old, stern Reverend, who also had a propensity for squashing innocent conversation about defying authority. He liked the kid though. She had an honest face and a propensity for mischief that he could relate to. 

However, one friend definitely wasn’t going to keep him at Lathander’s Light. Because worst of all for Sarin, he was naturally very relaxed. Lazy, Sarin's mother had called it, but he preferred to say selectively hardworking. Lathander's Light didn't appreciate his discerning work ethic, and consequently set him to hard labor paired, interestingly enough, with military strength-building exercises. Between the hardship of having to work cleaning endless prayer halls and latrines every day, then poring over boring religious texts, listening to Reverend Mathias preach to the assembly, and busting his butt on the impromptu assault course, his life had gone from the exciting existence of an up-and-comer in the criminal underworld to a never-ending chore. 

No, cult life just wasn't for him. He had given it, in his opinion, the tremendous effort of a good three days trial period and had sadly come to his conclusion. He should probably leave. 

Sarin was reflecting briefly on his decision in the Baptismal Chamber while eating some stolen sweet cakes. He always came here when he needed to think because the chamber was only used for special occasions and its tranquil stone wading pool provided some reprieve from the boring wood of the rest of the building. Today was a good day to try to escape, he mused, everyone was out at some worship ceremony off into the desert and he had feigned sickness to stay back and avoid all the wailing about light and god and worship and piety and light and god. Practically nobody else was here and if he could just make it through to the courtyard unseen by that ugly kitchen matron – BOOM.

The wall exploded behind him and his vision was overwhelmed with bright, golden light and terrifying flames. Sarin was knocked to the ground and rolled, his ears ringing wildly and his back burning as he watched the remains of the wall get quickly engulfed by flame. Scrambling, he instinctually dove for the pool of water. Sarin squeezed his eyes shut and dumped himself over the edge with an inelegant splash, the explosion and roaring flame above him muffled by the water. As the intense heat he had felt faded, he opened his eyes to look at the catastrophe that had interrupted his breakout planning. 

He looked up through the waters and saw the ramshackle ceiling was partially caved in on one side from the explosion. What was left of the roof above him was violently on fire and small embers were already dropping into his pool. He glanced at the room around him and saw that while the door leading further into the complex was fully collapsed from the while the eastern door was relatively unscathed, and its doorway led out into the courtyard. Freedom. Sarin swam to the eastern lip of the pool and surfaced, gasping but determined to make it out of the building alive.

He climbed unceremoniously out of the pool and was once again greeted by roaring flame and new plumes of thick smoke. Coughing, he ran for the eastern door, pulling his now soaked shirt up and over his mouth so he could try to breathe. Sarin’s eyes widened in panic. In just the short time he had been underwater, the fire had spread with otherworldly speed, consuming the timber of the ceiling and walls and even spreading out over the stone statues and metal. Yeah, Sarin thought, he was definitely not cut out for this shit. 

But where had this crazy fire come from? He knew that there were always braziers lit in the altar room but there wasn't anything explosive that he knew of in the complex. He had checked several times. For altruistic reasons. If altruistic meant reselling at a profit. 

He shouldered the door and burst into the courtyard before the fire crawled to the doorway and ignited the path behind him. He kept running until he was several feet clear of the structure before turning his head to look behind him. His eyes grew wide and he stumbled as he saw, over his shoulder, a huge beacon of golden light erupting from the middle of the complex, where the fire had originated. 

The light burst forth and into the sky with a brilliance that made Sarin's eyes water, but he couldn't look away. Hovering inside the column of ethereal light was that redheaded kid from before. Except her eyes were glowing bright white out of her scowling gaze and her jaw was set hard as she dragged the Reverend up and out of the rubble and into the strange beacon with one hand. She held him up high over her head and after he struggled and kicked for a few seconds tossed him, effortlessly, into the air. He landed a heap on the ground only a short way away from Sarin. Sarin stopped dead in his tracks and looked around for something to hide behind. He liked the girl well enough, but between the glowing, the hovering, the explosions, and the look of righteous fury on her face, he quickly decided that now was not the time to be in her way. He ducked behind a wooden climbing wall on the weird, improvised obstacle course and crouched down.

The angry girl descended slowly from the beam of light and floated over to where the Reverend lay groaning in the sand. As she got further from the beacon, her eyes returned to their natural green but she lost none of the rage in her expression. Her feet touched the ground and in one quick movement she unstrapped the halberd from her back and whipped it around her shoulders to end at a point towards the Reverend's throat, stopping his meager attempt to crawl away. Sarin had seen what that girl could do with the halberd during his first weapons training session. A chill went down his spine. She had wielded the weapon as an extension of herself, perfectly balanced and controlled as she tore apart a battalion of practice dummies singlehandedly.

"Audrey, you don't have to do this," groaned the Reverend.  

"Oh, but I really do Mathias, after everything you've done? To Lathander's Light? To me? Your grand plans for Chantelle?" Audrey said, menacing the halberd closer to him with every question. This piqued Sarin’s interest. Chantelle? What were they planning with his home turf?
    
"As you know, I am but an envoy for Lathander's will, child. I must see his light shone on this world according to my direction from the divine.”
    
"And THIS is his will?!" Audrey gestured in a sweeping motion toward the destruction around them. By now the whole complex was burning and torrents of flame shot into the sky. Sarin was surprised to see tears streaking down through the soot on Audrey's face. She really cared about the place.
    
"THIS is YOUR FAULT, Ward. Your destruction, your death, your retribution." Mathias said, sitting up and gripping the shaft of the halberd to pull it out of his face. 
    
"Oh that is such bullsh - " Audrey began but was cut off by Mathias, who grew bolder by the second. Standing up out of the dirt and twisting the halberd out of her grip in a deft move, Mathias threw the weapon aside and marched towards Audrey.
    
"YOU were the thorn in my side from the beginning, Champion. You were the reason all our plans continually went wrong. You will be remembered as Lathander's greatest failure and the reason everything went up in smoke today." What were they arguing about? Maybe who started the fire? It seemed pretty obvious, thought Sarin. His money was on the glow-y chick with the red hair that was still slightly on fire.
    
Audrey, much less threatening without her glowing eyes and wicked halberd, stepped back. 
    
"I don't care what lies you tell the rest of the congregation. You've gone too far Mathias. Military training? Arms stockpiles? And for what? Some fairy tale you're chasing in a city MILES from here? You may twist this story, but I'll never forget it."
    
Mathias reached into his robes and took out a short, intricately carved stick of wood. 
    
"Oh, thats where you're wrong, Ward. You will forget."
    
A huge flash of blue light erupted from the end of the wood - a wand, Sarin realized belatedly - and blasted Audrey back against the complex wall, white tendrils of smoke coming off her unconscious form. 
    
Mathias regarded her unmoving body for a few seconds from where he stood, nodded and then walked calmly back into the fire, which parted before him. When Sarin was reasonably sure Mathias was gone, he got up and raced over to where Audrey lay, shaking her shoulders.
    
"Hey. Hey, kid," he said, still shaking as her head lolled around. "C'mon you gotta wake up. I figure you're not dead since you're like an angel or something now but you gotta wake up." 
    
Audrey groaned and sat up slowly, shaking her head. "Oh my god, my whole body hurts..."
    
"Audrey this place is on fire and the Reverend is still hanging around," Sarin said urgently, "We gotta go."
    
"Wait what?" Audrey said, blinking hard and squinting at Sarin. "Hold on, who are you?"
    
"I'm one of the new acolytes, I told you those great jokes about dragon testicles."
    
"I...I have no clue what you're talking about. Where are we? Who am I?"
    
Sarin's eyes went wide as it clicked. Memory spell. Kid's brain was wiped. 
    
Audrey grabbed his shirt and pulled him down next to her "Do you know who I am? Why can't I remember anything? What are we doing here? God what the hell is going on."
    
Sarin nodded as his mind raced. A newly realized angelic powerhouse just got her past completely erased as her house burns down. First priority, don't go down with the ship.
    
"To answer your questions: yes, I do know you, no, I don't know, and you actually used to live here but its currently on fire so we gotta GO."
    
Audrey turned to face the fire and started, as if just noticing it for the first time, "The fire. My fault. Oh God, what have I done. What have I done?! Do you even know-" 

Sarin slapped her. 

“OW! What the hell?”

“Less existential crises more escaping!” Sarin shouted, trying to haul her up by the arm. She stood up shakily, but quickly found her footing. Without warning, she grabbed Sarin and slung him over her shoulder. She seemed driven by some unseen force, an almost base impulse.

“Woah, what do you think you’re doin-“  Sarin started before he was cut off by Audrey sprinting out of the courtyard. As he bobbled around on her back like a sack of potatoes, a plan started to form in Sarin's mind. In Chantelle, he stayed ahead of the competition mostly by being a shameless opportunist for both talent and profit. He knew a good opportunity when it dropped out of a glowing beacon.

Audrey blew past the empty gatehouse and ran out through the front entrance. She started to slow down and yelled behind her, "Why am I carrying you? You can probably walk right? What is up with me, I didn't even think I just scooped you up."

Glad he was out of her sight, Sarin grinned and yelled back "Your name is Audrey Ward and you're one of my enforcers. It must just be instinct to protect me."

Audrey stopped and set him down gently, her eyes wide with disbelief.

"I'm one of your enforcers? What does that even mean?"
    
Sarin simply smiled, thinking of all the ways a glowing demigod in his pocket would make life easier. 

"It means you work for me."
