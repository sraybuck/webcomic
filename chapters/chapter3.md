"I cannot *believe* you threw up on her shoes and then ran away." said Renard as they picked their way through the underground tunnel. He was leading the way with a torch though the narrow passageway which was dotted with ruined barrels, storage crates and other detritus from the smugglers who had used it before.

"Shut up! You gave me no warning! I got nervous!" said Audrey, putting her face in her hands.

"I had no idea you were a nervous puker. How was that never a problem in your line of work before?" teased Renard.

"It was never a problem because all I've had to do is kick doors, and punch huge thugs! Easy stuff!" Audrey said her voice raising in exasperation.

"Pity that we can never go back there now, I actually liked their ale." Renard replied, stepping through an enormous ruined cask.

Audrey grabbed the back of his shirt and wheeled him around to face her. She stared him down with a deadly serious look on her face. "Renard. I literally can never show my face in the textile district again."

Renard held her gaze for a second before laughing. "Aw well you can't weave so whats the point?" He patted her shoulder in mock sympathy and continued down the passageway. "Downtown is much more fun, more shops, more people, more sights. Also, is it just me or are there more of those Dancing Lights down there too?"

"Yeah, they get more concentrated towards the city center." replied Audrey. She paused, contemplating what Renard had told her back at the pub. "I think after this I may leave Chantelle altogether. You said I'm from Rusken, right?"

"Yep! I'm about ninety percent sure. Rusken or maybe like a remote tribe in the southern rainforests that coincidentally came up with the same accent. If you wanted, after we figure this whole thing out, I can try to break your memory charm."

Audrey nearly tripped over a half-rotting box. "You can do that?"

Renard threw a look over his shoulder back at her and shrugged. "Well, I can try. It'll likely be ridiculously difficult. The way you break the charm is you recreate an emotional trigger. Usually, you shoot for something that happened right around when they got charmed. Like revisiting where they were when it happened, since getting hit with a memory charm is usually a pretty notable occasion. But yours happened so long ago, I'm not sure where we'd start." He paused. "Its also a uh, pretty painful process."

They rounded a corner and the cramped, dirty corridor opened up into a much wider, stone passageway with unlit torches in recesses on the walls. The cobblestones underneath their feet were dirty and cracked, but a welcome change from the difficult terrain from before. The place creeped Audrey out. It felt like a deeply old place, more history was in these walls than she could see just from looking.

Audrey jogged to come up right beside Renard. "Painful?" she asked.

Renard reached up to swap his small, traveling torch with one of the big metal ones from the wall sconces. "Yeah. Your brain has to reknit the very fabric of your psyche to incorporate events that got ripped out of it. Usually that process gets worse the further out from the event you get. Yours was... what, three years ago?" 

"Something like that, yeah."

The new torch flared to life and its light cast huge shadows up and down the walls. Renard turned, his face now illuminated with the brighter light, revealing furrowed eyebrows and a worried look in his eye. 

"The longest curse I broke was maybe four months."

Audrey felt the blood drain from her face. "Shit."

"Yeah."

Renard held the torch aloft and they continued down the passageway in silence. Audrey looked at the stretched and warped shadows around her in the underground darkness. Would it be worth it to try to break the charm? Her life wasn't so bad. She had severed her ties with Sarin, but he would come looking for her. She would have to skip town, start over somewhere new. She shook her head. 
"I'm sick of running, Renard." she said aloud. "I'm sick of running away from my past, afraid and alone." She turned to him, and he gave her a weak smile. She felt herself smile too, despite her fear. "I'm not sure why, but I've felt more myself for the past three hours than I have in the past three years. If theres a chance we can face this head-on and break the charm, I have to try."

Renard gulped, then steeled his gaze. "Alright, I can give it a shot. Let's start with something easy, do you remember where you were when you got charmed?"

Audrey's mind flashed back to the wasteland. Her vision filled with flames as the fires burned so high they seemed to scrape the clouds. She remembered stumbling out of there, carrying Sarin and then turning to face the blaze. She felt her eyes burn with the beginnings of tears as she remembered what she saw. Buildings. Huts, houses, a huge central temple. She had no idea what it was, but she knew it had been her home. And she felt the old guilt well up inside her as she remembered seeing it turn to ash before her eyes.

Renard cleared his throat. "Hey, uh. You still with us, Audrey?"

Audrey mindlessly put her hand on the back of her neck, feeling the mark that she knew was there. "Somewhere in the Ferrow Wastes," she finally replied.

Renard's eyes opened wide in surprise. "The Ferrow- nobody lives out there! Its uninhabitable. There's just dunes for miles." 

"Well somebody used to." Audrey said, casting her eyes to the floor. "I got charmed after I burnt a whole town to the ground out there."

An uncomfortable silence fell between the two of them. They were still picking their way forward through the stone tunnel, and Audrey felt the walls start to narrow and the slope of the ground curl back upwards. 

Renard broke the silence with a hoarse whisper, not judgemental but simply awed, "Who the fuck *are* you?"

Audrey laughed humorlessly. "You're asking me?"

"Fair point. We're here."

The tunnel had finally leveled out and they had reached a large, ancient looking wooden door. Renard stepped up, put an ear to the door and closed his eyes. "Low voices on the other side. They sound far away, but we need to be careful. Hold the torch."

Audrey grabbed the torch from him as he pulled out his trusty lockpicks again. He delicately inserted them into the mechanism and went to work. Audrey glanced around the space. The doorway was made of stone, but cracked and old with small tendrils of grime and plantlife working its way into the tunnel. The wall sconces were still dotting the interior of the tunnel, but now most of the torches that would have hung in them were gone. Nobody had been down here in a very long time. 

Audrey heard a faint click as Renard unlocked the door. He motioned her over to him again and grabbed the torch. 

//THEY SNEAK IN

//more description
They emerged into a small, cramped room full of boxes. There were old wooden stairs leading into a doorway across the room.

//walk to next door
Audrey moved to slowly push the door open like before but Renard tapped her shoulder. As she turned to face him, he put a finger to his lips and motioned for Audrey to stay put. He crept over to the other side of the door and removed something else from his pouch, a small vial of viscous golden liquid. He used the dropper in the top to remove a small amount of the liquid and then delicately reached up to drop it into the lowest hinge. He stood up to his full height to get the middle hinge and stood on his tippy toes to try to reach the third. Audrey stifled a laugh before creeping over and picking him up to get the last one. When she put him down and he shot her a nasty look. She simply grinned and moved back beside the door, waiting for him to open it. Renard grabbed the handle and eased one shoulder into the door, which opened noiselessly. He took a small bow from behind the cover of the door and then poked his head out to survey the room. 


- in some basement, old dusty vases, chairs. Some kind of storage area. Can hear muffled yelling.
- move through the storage area and it leads to a side door in the sanctuary. Yelling is more defined.

//creep into sanctuary five figures, one at the altar, other four in a semicircle

"What do you mean they LOST it?" growled a voice coming from the center of the sanctuary near the enormous stone altar. 

"W-well it seems like the crew never showed up at the drop point outside.." another voice replied nervously. Audrey poked her head out from behind the column to try to get a better view. She saw a hooded figure facing the altar, with his spread atop it. The second voice had come from the semicircle of other robed figures a few feet behind the first one, his head was bent low in a bow and his shoulders seemed to be trembling. He had a close-cropped haircut and Audrey could see the glint of metal glasses frames on his face in the firelight. The hooded man sighed heavily. Then brought his hand down in a fist atop the altar, sending a resounding boom cascading around the interior of the building. Audrey felt herself jump slightly despite herself, and the second man nearly jumped out of his robes.

"You imbecile!" yelled, "We need that to open this blasted altar!"
"I-I don't know what happened." As he spoke again, a name popped into Audrey's head involuntarily. Aster. Her eyes widened. She felt something tugging at the back of her brain. Something really important. "We received confirmation not four hours ago that it was in the city."
Another voice piped up. "Couldn't we always just pry it off, Reverend? Why must we use the Conduit?"

The hooded figure, the Reverend, spoke slowly and deliberately, as if barely restraining himself. The firelight seemed to grow brighter for a second. "Because. The altar will only open for a display of true light magic. My conjurations alone are not enough to coax it open. We need a conduit." 

He turned to face his followers and Audrey tried to make out any distinguishing features beneath the shadows of the hood. She squinted but couldn't see any definition in the low light. He raised a hand to his head and spoke again, less forcefully. 

"Blast, that Sarin was always incompetent, even at the first Ark he was a lazy idiot." 

"So what do we do now, Reverend?"
Audrey watches as the Reverend slowly clenches and unclenches his fists. Out of the corner of her eyes, she sees Renard waving wildly, and pointing at the torches on the walls. Audrey watched, transfixed, as the torches grew and shrunk in time with the figure's fists opening and closing. Finally he spoke again.

"This is simply an obstacle placed in our path by Lathander himself. I am meant to retrieve it alone, I had suspected as much."

The short one spoke up again, "Then why did we - "

"Brother Talmus, do you question the divine will of Lathander?" the Reverend cut him off in a high and mighty voice. The flames grew higher.

"Uh-h n-no, Reverend." he stuttered. 

"Because if you were, I would invite you to save your questioning until we retrieve the Divine Transparency. Then you can ask Him yourself, and explain why, when we are at the eve of finally acquiring our faith's most sacred artifact, you were UNDERMINING. HIS. DIVINE. AUTHORITY." With each of the last words the flames grew larger. The followers huddled closer together, away from the aisle torches, obviously terrified. Audrey felt an old anger well up inside her. She had been here before somehow. Not at this place but in this feeling. She felt that something in the back of her head start to wiggle free. She knew Aster. She recognized the cowering of the other figures. She turned her gaze upon the hooded figure again. That voice... she knew that voice...
 
"Your grace," Aster cut in holding an arm in front of the one who had drawn the Reverend's ire. "I would, of course, never question your authority over interpreting the Will of our Lord. But isn't the only person who can wield the Transparency the foretold Champion?

The Reverend grasped his hands into fists once again and the fire grew. But then the tension left his robed figure and he let out a humorless laugh. He began to pase back and forth in front of the altar. "Ah, see that is another point of obstacle." He tutted. "Now as you know, the previous Champion was a traitor and a scoundrel. At our moment of greatest need and advantage, she abandoned us and destroyed our home. However, I believe she was a false idol sent to distract us from our true path. From my true path."

"Um, sir?" replied Aster.

The Reverend turned to face the followers once again. "Who delivered you from the desert? Who has created this new covenant with our Lord? Who has searched tirelessly to find our means of bringing him forth once again? And who has interpreted his Will as a faithful servant for all these years?"

Again his voice rose with each question, the intensity in his voice was intoxicating and terrifying. Audrey felt her skin crawl but she couldn't tear her eyes away. Her brain began to flood in with repressed emotion. She KNEW this man. She HATED this man. But she had no idea who he was. 

At that moment, he threw back his hood to reveal a face marred with hard living and flames. Bright white hair, in a wispy shock on his head. More wrinkles than Audrey recognized, but his eyes. Audrey knew those eyes. Dark, almost black eyes full of confidence and charisma, but devoid of empathy. Mathias. As she gazed upon his face now, she felt years of rage and heartbreak was over her. Her eyes blurred with tears but she couldn't look away. She saw something new underneath the facade of cool logic and control he presented to his acolytes. There was an unfocusedness to his eyes. As if he were looking beyond them all to something higher.Madness, Audrey realized. He's completely lost it.

She turned to Renard in panic, who met her eyes and mouthed "He's fucking crazy."

Audrey could only nod, almost paralyzed by fear and anger. She couldn't remember fully, but she knew this was the man that had torn her past from her. And now he was claiming to be some foretold savior. Her grip tightened on the cylinder and she felt that strange familiar power rise up in her again.

Aster spoke up again, this time in a small voice, so quiet Audrey could barely hear it from her hiding place. There was tension in his body, from terror or outrage, she couldn't tell.

"You? Our Reverend?" he answered.

"No, not Reverend." Mathias said. "Champion. I am the true blood of Lathander, sent to deliver this plane from evil."

Aster broke away from the other acolytes and began to yell, tears in his eyes.

"Reverend, this is insane! You cannot assume the power meant for the divine!"

Mathias simply looked down his nose at Aster, and sneered in disgust. "And who are you to stop me?"

At the same moment Mathias's fists burst alight in flame, Audrey felt her own power ignite within her.

With speed she had never felt before she sprinted across the sanctuary. Time seemed to slow down. She faintly heard Renard screaming "NO!" as she streaked towards Mathias. She saw surprise, then malice on his face as he raised his hands in a fiery circle to attack Aster. Aster was hunched down throwing his arms over his head as if to shield himself. She saw his bespectacled eyes open and jaw drop as he saw her running towards him. Audrey jumped and yelled, trying to put her own body in between Mathias and Aster. Mathias laughed, loud and unhinged and from his hands, she saw an enormous fireball erupt and streak across the sanctuary. Audrey flew through the air, on a collision course with the flaming wheel. 

She felt the heat first, and then the impact. It was like she had been crushed by the weight of the entire city, she felt her sore shoulder tear completely, and robs crack within her chest. Then the pain. She felt like she was being dipped in molten lava, burning on every part of her body. She screamed but couldn't hear herself, only a ringing from the explosion of impact. She felt herself get thrown high into the air, crashing through the stained glass before she lost consciousness. The cold night air barely registered on her fried skin, but her final sight was the lights hanging low in the air around Chantelle, glowing brilliantly. She felt herself smile, and then her consciousness drifted away as she plummeted back towards the ground.
