# Chapter 1: The Job

The famous dancing lights of Chantelle hung low over the gothic cityscape, illuminating the slick cobblestones and sending long, stretched shadows tumbling down narrow alleyways. The soft, glowing globules of lights that floated and twinkled their way down paved thoroughfares and up shooting towers were synonymous with Chantelle itself, the lights had been there for as long as anyone remembered in the city, and they were always welcome to illuminate the cold, damp nights. Always welcome, except by Audrey Ward. 

Audrey's work was conducted deep in the shadows, the dark alleyways and the unseen hovels of the city. She picked her way through a narrow alleyway on the edge of the textile district, the smells of strong dyes and hard work reeking in the air around her. As she crept through the shadows, she took pains to avoid the inviting glow of the dancing lights. She strayed far from the light partially out of professional diligence but also personal preference. The motes of bright yellow light made her uncomfortable, like someone was watching her. 

As she reached the end of the alleyway, she poked her head out into the street. Mostly deserted at this late hour, she put her head down and followed edge of the paved road deeper into the city. She passed mostly factories and workshops but a few taverns and bars were open to cater to the workers. She crossed the street as she approached one dubbed "The Wandering Wyvern", avoiding the bright light and loud patrons. As she popped the collar on her traveling cloak to hide part of her face, she heard a drunken voice yell "HEY!" Involuntarily, her head whipped around to the loud call and she cursed herself internally at her reaction. Man, she had to get better at this stealth thing. As she looked to the noise, her eyes settled on a drunken man outside the bar. He was trying to catch one of the low-hanging lights in his hands without much luck. As he jumped and threw an open palm around the light, it suddenly shifted a foot to the left, leaving him empty handed. He called out more indignantly this time "HEY STOP THAT!" Audrey felt her shoulders relax and she released a breath she didn't know she was holding. Just some drunk dude making a fool of himself. If she had been spotted here it would've meant backtracking through the canals and around the Cathedral, which would make her later than she already was. She started shook her head and turned to start walking again. She had to stay focused.

"Duron! You can't catch the lights, c'mon you know that quit making a fool of yourself." Another man joined the drunk one, Duron apparently, outside the tavern. "Aw, c'mon babe I'm trying to catch one for you," Duron said, taking a little too long to turn away from the inviting glow of the lights.

[SCENE WHERE AUDREY IS LONELYYYYYYYYYY]

As Audrey approached the low wall, she heard voices arguing.

"Renard, look I know you're new here but usually we try to stay /quiet/ when we're stealing shit alright?"

"Why bother? These guys are clearly idiots, Szet, they left the lights on inside a safehouse at night. Like c'mon anyone within a mile radius can tell your supposedly abandoned warehouse is full of people, which means theres something worth some amount of money to someone in there. Total amateur hour."

"I don't care how bad these guys are, if you give our position away because you can't shut up I'll kill you right here."

"Okay calm down, yeesh, I'm just making conversation... Oh look who decided to show up!"

Audrey had crouched down beside the wall next to her two crew members. She nodded to Szet, who was right next to her. She had worked several jobs with the lizardfolk man before, he was a harsh boss who had high expectation from his subordinates and a mean streak a mile wide. He wore a gnarled sneer on his face and his battered leather armor. Clearly he expected some action tonight. 

Next to him was someone Audrey, didn't recognize. A small gnomish man - boy really, he looked about Audrey's age if not younger  - stood next to Szet. He was short enough that he could stand at his full height behind the wall and still be completely concealed. His clothes were all mottled black and dark brown tones that blended into the cityscape behind him and made it hard to pin down exactly where his figure ended and the wall began. He stood looking at her with his hands on his hips and his right eyebrow cocked up. 

"Well, Miss Ten Minutes Late, are you gonna introduce yourself?" he said.

Audrey blinked at him and then quickly reached her arm around Szet to shake his hand, "I'm Audrey, sorry for the delay. Got sidetracked."

"Renard. And it's perfectly fine. We used the extra time to discuss how exactly we're gonna break into this joint. Szet says the front door is too obvious but I say these guys are hacks and we're gonna catch them napping."

Szet let out an exasperated sigh and pinched the scales between his eyes. "Look, we have procedures in place. We have standards. Just because you're new doesn't excuse sloppy execution, Renard. I don't care how dumb you think these guys are, we're not all going in the front door."

"You don't even have a nose why are you trying to pinch the bridge of it?"

"Because thats how much you fucking bother me Renard."

"Alright then, why don't I take Audrey and go in the front door while you go in the back."

Audrey chimed in, "Wait don't I get a say in this - "

Renard plowed forward completely undeterred. "Look worst case scenario, we alert them and cause a distraction while you get behind them. Best case scenario, we all get in there unnoticed and its a piece of cake. Its a win-win."

Audrey started again, "Okay I haven't agreed to any of this, I mean it might work but-"

"Works for me if it means I don't have to listen to you for five fucking minutes," Szet spat. He turned to Audrey, "You're on babysitting duty. Don't let him do anything stupid, Ward." He quickly vaulted over the low wall and started towards the warehouse in a serpentine sprint, quickly weaving back and forth across the cobblestones. 

"I'm surprised," Audrey said as they watched him disappear behind the structure. "Usually it takes me about fifteen minutes to piss him off that bad, you did it in less than five."

"Oh you missed the ten minutes before where I was asking him all about his fashion choices. Seriously? Worn leather to a stealth mission? People are gonna clock you as a thug so quickly, you'll never get your foot in the door."

"Well isn't that your job Mr. Thieves Tools over there?" Audrey said, pointing to a set of delicate metal sticks that resembled oversize clockmakers tools that he had just pulled out of a pouch around his waist. 

"What me? Oh how could I do anything correctly without a 'babysitter,' Audrey? I'm practically incompetent without supervision." Renard said, flicking his dark hood over his head.

"To be fair, you're an unvetted contractor though right? Walk-in off the street." Audrey replied. His file had been included in her briefing for this job, not much was in it but that spoke volumes in Chantelle's criminal underground. No info means new, careful, or suspicious. He definitely wasn't new, but Audrey was having trouble deciding which of the other two fit. "Can't exactly trust someone with big roles when you can't know if they're the real deal."

"Oh Audrey, I assure you I'm the real deal" he grinned. "Now lets get moving. I can't let that ornery salamander beat us to prize."

Audrey left the cover of the wall first and carefully crept across the cobblestone road, still crouching and sticking to the shadows of the tall buildings around her. She placed her feet delicately, trying to not make noise to alert anyone to her approach. She made it into the darkness of the front doorway and watched the street for her companion. She saw an amorphous dark shape moving in the street, but quickly lost track of it. She shook her head and squinted, trying to catch the movement again. Damn, that weird camouflage worked well. 

She heard a voice from behind her loudly say "You're not a particularly good babysitter." Audrey jumped and swung around, her hand on the handle of the knife in her belt.

Renard was leaning in the doorway, still grinning. "Well you're not a particularly good thief if you don't keep your voice down," Audrey hissed back at him. 

Renard rolled his eyes and lazily stood up from the doorway and went to tinkering with the lock. He pulled out two of the delicate tools Audrey had seen earlier, probably lockpicks, and he inserted them into the mechanism. 

"Why bother staying quiet? I can hear them talking from here, hired goons usually aren't the best at keeping a low profile. Whoever set up this safehouse is a total hack." He paused and then shot her a mischevious glance from over his shoulder. "And who are you to lecture me on quiet? You were probably in charge of breaking the doors down in order to get in places before you had me on the team, right?"

Audrey opened her mouth to respond and then quickly closed it. She had worn her special heavy boots explicitly for that purpose today. But, she didn't need to let him know that. 

Renard chuckled slightly and turned his attention back to picking the lock. He stuck his ear to the door and closed his eyes, his hands working in practiced tandem as he listened to the tumblers aligning. After a few seconds Audrey heard a slight click as Renard stepped back from the door and turned the knob. The old door opened noiselessly to reveal the stark interior of a storage warehouse. Boxes and pallettes were stacked along three walls while to the right there were wooden stairs leading up to a second level. Sure enough, now that the door was open Audrey could hear the sound of several voices arguing jovially and over the racket of some kind of musical instrument. A lute maybe? It was hard to tell since whoever was playing was clearly not very good as harsh notes floated down the stairway. 

Audrey and Renard stepped inside quickly and closed the door behind them. Audrey glanced around the stacks of boxes for Szet, but she couldn't see him.

"Huh, Szet is taking longer than usual," she commented idly. He usually insisted on being the first one in the door during missions like these.

"Oh thats because there's a spring-loaded trap on the back doorstep." Renard said, dragging a finger through the dust that had settled atop a nearby box.

"Oh my Gods you already knew and you sent him back there anyways?" Audrey said, fighting down laughter. Szet definitely had it coming.

"Well he clearly didn't want to go with little old /me/ so I figured I'd give him an alternative." Renard said innocently while pouting and making big eyes back at Audrey.

"You are one tough gnome, man." 

"Why thank you, I do try to uphold the good name."

It was then that the back door flew open and slammed against the inside wall with a resounding crack. The music upstairs faltered and the loud voices instantly fell to hushed tones. Stomping up the steps was Szet, whos leather armor was visibly smoking and charred from a huge burn on the left shoulder. He marched over to the two of them and grabbed Renard by the front of the shirt and lifted him into the air.

"You're going to pay for that one, you worthless sack of mindflayer sh-" his voice was immediately muffled as Renard put his hand over his mouth and pointed upstairs.

Szet caught the meaning as he heard the concerned muttering from above, placed him down and hissed to the two of them, "Stay here. I'll deal with this." He glowered at Renard before creeping up the stairs.

Renard turned to Audrey. "Whats he gonna do? This mission was classified as just a sneak in, sneak out kind of deal!" he whispered.

Audrey's face darkened. "I don't like it either." Was all she could say. Up above the whispering gave way to a strangled scream and yelling. One voice called out "Get him! Dear Gods, protect us!" Audrey heard the noise of a musical instrument breaking, two more screams and then silence.

"Well thats...sickening!" Renard said brightly.

"Thats how Sarin's crew handles things." Audrey replied, beginning to look over box labels. They were here for some kind of package from Kazar in the south.

"Aren't you an enforcer? Don't you typically do the rough 'em up stuff?"

"Why are you so interested?" Audrey said, turning to face him. "You don't even know me."

Renard shrugged. "You don't seem to be the type to work this kind of gig is all. You've got the big and strong thing down but none of the bloodlust and criminal intrigue as far as I can tell."

Audrey sighed, "I used to be an enforcer. I just couldn't stomach it. Got trained in pickpocketing and burglary stuff in my free time so I could switch jobs."

"Huh. You always work for Sarin, then?"

"Long as I can remember."

Renard perked up at that comment. He abandoned the box he had been rummaging through and turned to face her fully. "You ever consider not working for him?"

Audrey opened her mouth to reply but was cut off by a shout from above: "Did you two already get the fourth guy?"

Renard turned and yelled up to Szet: "What fourth one? I only heard three!"

"Theres four bunks up here!"

"Oh shit -" was all Renard managed to say before he was clocked upside the head by an oblong cylindrical package. Creeping in from the broken back door was a huge bald man with grey stubble and an eyepatch. He sneered at Audrey as he swung the package her way. Audrey knew what to do. She instinctively rolled to the side and landed back up on her feet, inside the reach of the package. The man stumbled slightly from the weight of the package hitting only air, and while he was off balance Audrey clocked him with an uppercut that sent him tumbling over. As he went down she made a mad grab to get the package out of his hands. She grasped one end of the cylinder but only managed to rip some of the shipping paper off the very end as the man held onto his end. 

As he was falling, she glanced down at the paper in her hands and saw that she had grabbed part of the shipping label. Someone had printed in huge red lettering: "Direct shipping Kazar to Chantelle. Magical items tax on arrival." She looked and saw that the paper she had torn off revealed the very end of the package's contents. It was some kind of huge, bronze tube with intricate carvings in geometric patterns all around it, disappearing under the rest of the shipping paper.

"Uh guys, I think this one's trying to murder me with the thing we're here to get!" Audrey yelled.

Szet yelled down from overhead, "Well end it quickly then, Ward!" 

The man had gone down next to where Renard was on the ground, holding his head. The man sneered and got back onto his feet and tried a savage overhead blow. Audrey was ready. She sidestepped so it came down right next to her, got inside of his guard again and brutally punched his left elbow with a sickening crunch. The man yelled out in pain lost his grip on the cylinder, but whipped his uninjured arm around in a desperate blow. It caught Audrey by surprise as she socked in shoulder and stumbled back a few step. The cylinder clattered to the ground and rolled away from the fight.

She heard Szet yell again from above "Quit playing with him! Just end it!"

She grit her teeth and said "Easier said than done" under her breath. The man was now backed up into the front doorway and Audrey was in the middle of the room. He looked at her, then at the cylinder. She knew the obvious move here would be to make a grab for the cylinder and then bolt. So she tried something else. 

As the man dove for the cylinder on the ground, Audrey ran straight for him. She plowed into him with her right shoulder down and tried to pin him against the door. Audrey felt her body slam into the man as he slammed into the door. The door splintered and creaked under the impact. Her shoulder joint screamed in pain at the force of her blow. She felt the man cry out but he began to regroup as she bounced off of him and regained her footing just in front of him. He tried to lunge at her, but Audrey was too fast. With blinding strength and speed she brought up her leg and kicked him full in the chest, with her special kicking boots, sending him flying towards the door again. This time, he fully crashed through the damaged wood and tumbled backwards down the steps and fell, sprawled out on the pavement in the shadows of the street. 

Audrey stepped through the ruined doorframe. The man was groaning on the ground and bleeding from the splinters of wood that grazed him on the way through the rough door. She glanced over her shoulder, and saw Renard on the ground but still watching her. She jogged over the where the man lay and he curled on the ground and said "No more! Gods, that was fucking painful." 

She grabbed his arm and hauled him to his feet "Shut up!" She hissed so just they could hear. "Run. Run now or the other one will kill you." 
The man's remaining eye went wide and he stumbled back from her, holding his injured arm. "But, but why spare me?"

"Just run!" She hissed again, but this time her voice sounded different. As if two Audreys were talking at once, and in a much deeper voice than normal. She felt the breeze pick up behind her and felt a strange, warm power flow through her. Instead of struggling to see details in the darkness, she saw everything as clearly as if it were fully daylight. She could pick out the individual follicles of stubble on the man's terrified face. She could see the tear forming in his wide eye and the blood dripping from a cut on his temple. The man screamed and sprinted away from her. 

The darkness engulfed her vision again as she felt the breeze die behind her and the mysterious power leave her. As she felt the strange strength draining from her limbs, she realized that she was terrified, but not surprised. The feeling was familiar, but brought forth a well of repressed emotions. Guilt. Loneliness. Pain. Loss. She didn't know the last time she felt that power, but she could make an educated guess. It probably had something to do with watching a life she didn't recognize go up in flames in the middle of a wasteland. 

She turned back to the warehouse and saw Renard in the doorframe now joined by Szet. Renard's mouth was hanging wide open and his eyes were the size of dinnerplates. Szet was simply shaking his head as he watched the goon run away from her. 

Audrey trudged back through the door and wordlessly moved past the both of them. Renard seemed like he wanted to say something but was uncharacteristically speechless. Good. She didn't want to talk right now.

She picked up the bronze cylinder, undamaged from its ordeal as a makeshift club, and hefted it easily onto one shoulder. She looked to Szet. He sneered at her but turned to Renard. "Wait outside with Ward. I'll cover our tracks."

Renard finally closed his mouth and nodded. He walked through the doorframe but turned and shot an expectant glance at Audrey. He was waiting for her to follow. She joined him outside and they both sat down on the low wall they had been hiding behind across the street.

A few moments of silence passed between them as they saw flashes of Szet rummaging inside the warehouse. 

Renard was the first to break the silence. "Szet didn't see you. He came down right when the goon ran away but he missed the lightshow."

Audrey grunted in response.

Renard continued. "You ever do that before?"

"Probably."

"Probably? How can you not know?"

"I can't remember."

They let a few beats of silence pass between them before Renard spoke up again.

"You never answered my question."

"What question?"

"You ever consider not working for Sarin."

Audrey looked at her feet. Sarin was the one who had found her in the desert. He had told her what he knew about her and given her a job. He got her set up with a place here in Chantelle and given her steady work for the past four years. 

Audrey looked back up at the warehouse and saw Szet standing outside. He was holding a bottle of some clear liquid with a flaming rag stuffed in the top. He threw it into the doorway and the whole inside lit up in an enormous blaze. 

Sarin had also probably tricked her, she thought. She never truly believed she had originally been a criminal. And he never explained what they were doing in the desert. He forced her to do his dirty work. Made her work with the most unpleasant people like Szet because she was so deeply indebted to him she had no way to refuse. She had hurt people. A lot of people. For a man she only now realized, she truly detested.

She turned to Renard, who was just looking at her. Gauging her response.

Finally she said "Yeah. Yeah I'd considering it."

Renard, who had up until this point been dead serious, cracked that mischevious grin again. "Then lets get out of here."

At that moment, Szet walked away from the burning warehouse and joined them by the wall. Audrey felt anger slowly welling up inside her.

"Sloppy work, Ward. We can't have witnesses running around. And you Renard, you and I are gonna have a long conversation when we get back to the hideout. This whole thing was a disaster! I'm surprised you two managed to get in the front door at all, just the general level of incompeten - "

Szet was silenced by the enormous cylinder coming down hard directly on top of his head. Audrey had heard enough from this guy tonight. Szet crashed hard onto the cobblestones, completely out cold. Renard hopped down off the wall and spit directly on Szet's face. 

"I've only known this guy a half hour and I can already tell he deserved that," Renard said "Well, now that we're both probably unemployed...You wanna go get a drink?"

Audrey laughed. "A drink sounds pretty good right about now."
