"Done!" Lyra shouted from the other end of the yard. Audrey jumped down from her perch atop one of the fence posts and dashed over to Lyra's improvised weapons forge. Spread out in front of the smaller girl was a vast array of sticks, ropes, rocks, and nails. Lyra had even scrounged up a discarded hammer to whack her creations into existence. Currently, she was crouched on the ground, adjusting a long piece of grass that wrapped around the hilt of a small, wooden sword. 

Audrey slowed down on her approach and then stood just behind Lyra, her hands on her hips and her head tilted, thinking.

Lyra turned and noticed Audrey's uncharacteristic pensive look. 

"What?" She asked, standing up and handing the sword to Audrey.

"Nothing." Audrey said turning it over in her hands. The excitement she was feeling just moments ago had all but evaporated.

"No, tell me. You've got this weird look."

"Well its just..."

"..yeah?"

"I kind of was expecting..."

"Oh my god, Audrey what?"

"... Well I thought it would be BIGGER is all."

Lyra rolled her eyes and snatched the sword back. "You thought it would be bigger," she said. 

"Yeah..."

Lyra turned and scoffed." I should have known," She announced to the air behind her. "So typical! So unappreciative!"  She said walking away from Audrey and towards the edge of the yard.  

"I'm not unappreciative!" Audrey pouted following her towards the hedge line, "You told me this would be the best thing you've ever made and it just seems like it would have been bigger if it was the best one.."

"Bigger huh," She crouched down and fished into the bush adjacent to her tiny forge. "Bigger... LIKE THIS?" She dramatically whipped a huge weapon out from its place hidden deep in the branches of the bush. To an onlooker, the improvised weapon looked like a dangerous, scavenged hunk of junk. To Audrey, it was beautiful.

A long, thick tree branch formed the staff of the weapon with a misshapen, pointed clay shard tied to the front end forming a small axe. A halberd. A real halberd.

"WOAHHHHHH! How long have you been hiding that? Is it for me?"

"I don't know. Is it big enough?"

"Lyra, oh you sneaky jerk, give it here." Audrey said, making a mad grab for the makeshift halberd.

[STRUGGLE STRUGGLE]

"Hey! What are you two doing out here?" Audrey and Lyra froze mid-scuffle. It was Mistress Hawthrone. An older woman in a conservative, dark dress and a severe bun stepped out into the yard from the orphanage's side entrance. "I swear, every day with you two its something new - Wait. What is that terrifying contraption, Lyra?" Audrey turned her head and met Lyra's eyes with her own from her uncomfortable position stuck in Lyra's headlock. They both immediately let go and scrambled to their feet to face the Mistress. Lyra tucked the enormous halberd behind her. She was far from tall enough to hide the entire weapon but she made a remarkable effort, Audrey thought.

"Nothing Mistress Hawthorne! Just a dumb toy I made." Lyra said quickly.

"Nonsense, hand it over" snapped Hawthorne, thrusting her hand out in front of her.

Reluctantly, Lyra placed the halberd into her outstretched palm. Hawthorne turned it over in her hands for a few seconds with an incredulous look. Audrey held her breath. She really did NOT want to be stuck cleaning the little kids' toilets, especially not for the third time this week.

"Hm. While this undoubtedly an accident waiting to happen, it does have some very nice craftsmanship. How did you get the rope to secure this axe blade?"

"Well," Lyra began hesitantly. "I triple braieded some twine we had laying around the sewing supplies and dulled the edges of the shard."

"Hm. Smart." Hawthorn turned to Audrey. "Well, Ward? What were you planning to do with this?" she asked, eyeing the odd display of pots and bowls in the yard.

Audrey paled. While Lyra's arts and crafts was mostly benign, Audrey's own plans for the finished product were a little less so.

"Well?" Hawthrone prodded. 

"Um, actually Mistress. Its a bit difficult to explain," began Lyra, turning to look at Audrey. 

"Perhaps, a demonstration would be easier?" she said, winking at Audrey. Audrey felt her cheeks redden and her stomach flip while a mischevious smile played acoss her face.

"Yeah. It would be much easier to just show you." 
Hawthorne turned back to the two girls with narrowed eyes. She stared at them for a few seconds before handing the halberd back with a sigh. "Audrey, just the pots. Please no property damage."

Audrey grabbed the weapon and immediately yelled out an incoherent battle cry as she rushed the clay pots she had meticulously arranged. 

Lyra whooped as Audrey shattered every pot in sequence with a series of whirling, overhead and underhand strikes. Audrey grinned as the sounds of breaking pottery filled the air. She spun and jumped and sidestepped her way through the array, ending with a flourish as she brought the wicked weapon down to crush the enormous tree pot she had placed at the center of the arc. She breathed hard for a few seconds.

"Terrible stance Ward," called out Hawthorne "But overall not bad. Where did you learn to do that?"

Audrey turned in surprise at the backhanded compliment. She had been sure this stunt was a trap intended to land her in cleaning duty.

"Um, I'm not sure. I've always had a knack for breaking stuff I guess. I'm mostly moving on instinct."

"All too true, child. I still need to replace that bookshelf..." Hawthorne replied rubbing her chin, "And why did you always keep your back to that lone post?"

"Huh?" said Audrey. Post? She turned and looked behind her and sure enough, a rotted post of wood was a few feet behind her. She hadn't even noticed it was there but she realized through her circle of attack she had always been pivoting around it.

"Hm." said Hawthorne "I suppose it was instinct again?"

"Yeah. I guess I thought I was protecting somebody.." Audrey trailed off as her eyes flicked back to where Lyra stood with a wide smile on her face. Audrey felt her cheeks darken again before Hawthorne piped up.

"Well I'm sorry to interrupt such a productive afternoon for you two, but Ward, you are needed in the office. There's some people who want to meet you."

Audrey sighed. Probably more locals looking for apprentices. Audrey had blown it the last three times she was considered for a position, and was dreading this next one. It wasn't her fault that the priest had droned on so long that she fell asleep. Or that the blacksmith hadn't enjoyed her accidentally breaking his pliers. Or that the farmer didn't think it was funny when she swiped his hat while he wasn't looking.

She jogged back over to Lyra and handed her back the halberd. She would be back for it again tomorrow. Lyra took it begrudgingly. "Once you're done come back outside, alright? I have another surprise for you."

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "Sounds like a plan," she grinned. She turned to follow Hawthorne back inside and glanced covertly back at Lyra. Lyra was still gripping the halberd and watching as Audrey walked away. 

[WALKING THROUGH THE ORPHANAGE, NEED DESCRIPTION HERE, ENTER THE OFFICE]

"Is this the girl?" the man in front asked, expressionless.

"Yes," Hawthorne said reluctantly, "but the rumors are very overstated, the mark is simply a strange birthmark." 

"Girl," the man barked, "turn around."

Audrey looks to Hawthorne. She seemed uncharacteristically stressed. Usually she navigated these meetings with a given authority and disdain. Now, she looked like she was making up her mind whether to run or punch the man. She gave a terse nod to Audrey, while staring directly at the man, her fists clenched and knuckles pure white. 

Audrey reached behind her to bring her wild ponytail over her shoulder and turned around to display the back of her neck. She heard the group of robed men gasp. She rolled her eyes. At this point, her birthmark was old news to her. She'd had the strange sun icon there for as long as she could remember. It was a small insignia of a setting sun, with huge rays extending up her neck and over the base of her skull, into the hairline.

"This is her. This is the Champion. We've been searching for so long..." whispered one of the robed men in awe as Audrey turned back around. Champion. She liked the sound of that. If she was a Champion, would she be able to get a real, metal halberd? 

Hawthorne seemed less excited about this prospect. "This could still merely be a coincidence, Reverend. What exactly is the nature of this Champion you've been seeking?"

The bookish looking man piped up from behind the main guy, apparently the Reverend. "Well, the champion is a legend of old in our religion, as you know, Sister. The Champion is supposed to appear in a time preceding great upheaval in the forces of light, and guide us along the true path as we negotiate the evils and false idols of this la-" he stopped short as the Reverend held up his hand to silence him.

"There are many interpretations," the Reverend said "however the most prevalent one is that The Champion is Lathander's servant in the mortal realm. Assisting in guiding his will as it is completed among us. She is fabled to be extremely powerful but needing in a firm hand to guide her more ... untamed potential." he says as he looks Audrey up and down with disdain. Audrey looked down at her clothes. Her shirt was disheveled from swinging around the halberd earlier and she was wearing her pants that had been patched in the knee from the bookshelf incident. The Reverend continued, "We can provide such a hand." 

"Well you'll need to submit a formal application and complete the requisite paperwork and interviews. We don't let just anyone waltz right in here and demand a child," Hawthorne snapped.

The Reverend turned to the other acolytes. "Could you give us the room please? The good Mistress and I need to have a private conversation." 
Audrey stood resolutely between Mathias and Hawthorne. Audrey was only twelve, but she was pretty good at reading people. This Reverend made Hawthorne feel threatened. And while Hawthorne and Audrey have had their differences, Hawthorne always stuck up for Audrey. "I'm not leaving," she said, staring directly at the Reverend.

Hawthorne turned to her in surprise. Her shoulders relaxed minutely and a small smile tugged on her lips. "Audrey, it's okay. I'll be fine." she said, trying to be reassuring.

Audrey held the older woman's gaze, searching for an excuse to stay. Audrey didn't understand, why would she talk to this guy? She was clearly scared.

//She steps out the door and finds the acolytes clamoring outside. Each one shakes her hand and introduces themselves. Reminiscent of HP Leaky Cauldron scene. The Reverend stepped out after a few minutes and looks very satisfied. "Audrey, we've just completed the necessary steps and I am pleased to tell you that you can begin your duties as Champion at once."  

//BOOKISH ONE IS NAMED ASTER

"What?!"

"You are to leave this place immediately and accompany us to Lathander's Light in the Ferrow Wastes."

"I don't... You can't do this!"

"I'm afraid we can. You see, I am now your legal guardian." he said, producing a document. Audrey stared at it in disbelief. The top said "Writ of Guardianship" and the bottom bore Hawthorne's, small, jagged signature.

"Hawthorne would have never agreed to that!" Audrey yelled in outrage, pushing past him back into the office.

Audrey moved past the Reverend with a surprising speed, startling the bespectacled acolyte she had been talking to. He stuttered out "Y-yes, of course, it makes sense she wants to say goodbye to her former guardian before we leave, right Mathias?"

Audrey heard the Reverend simply grunt and reply "Make sure she's in the wagon in five minutes."

Audrey flung open the door to the office and saw Hawthorne leaning against the desk with her back turned to the door, clutching her shoulders. A strange smell was in the air, something acrid and almost like ... smoke. Audrey rushed to the woman, "Hawthorne? Are you okay? Whats going on?"

Hawthorne glanced down and Audrey saw that the color had drained from her face. She was shaking slightly as she faced Audrey, before taking a deep breath and composing herself. 

"Audrey, I can no longer keep you safe from this. I knew that they would come eventually. That mark couldn't mean much else..." 

Audrey balked. "What? You knew what that mark meant? And you didn't tell me?"

Hawthorne gave her a sad smile. "I figured it would be safer without you knowing what it was. Even I truly don't know what this Champion mythos truly is. But there are too many similarities between you and the figure foretold in legend."

"You knew, and they called you Sister. Do you know these guys?"

"I left Lathander's Light years many ago for my own reasons." Audrey's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Hawthorne's eyes flickered to the acolytes collected in the doorway and lowered her voice. "I must urge you, child. Be very careful. Around the Reverend especially. I don't think there's anything left that I can do to shield you from this."

"You could  have not signed the paper! That would have 'shielded me', Hawthorne!"

The older woman looked at her with genuine confusion on her face. "The paper?"

"Yes! The writ of adoption!"

Hawthorne's eyes widened. "Not again, I only just remembered..." She buried her face in her hands, leaning bodily back into the desk.
Audrey felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She turned and saw the acolytes closing in on her. The bookish one stayed in the doorway with a pained look on his face. "Please! Be careful with her!" he cried. 

One of the men closest to her moved quickly to grab her but Audrey saw the move coming. She clicked into the placid place her mind had been in the courtyard with the pots and sidestepped his grasp. The man nearly fell over has his hand found only air where she had been moments before. The next one spread his arms wide and approached, trying to corner her and cut off her escape. Audrey quickly dropped to the floor and swept her foot in a half circle, knocking his legs out from under him before vaulting over the desk. She had to escape. This was insane. She couldn't go with these guys, destiny or no destiny. Something was very wrong here. 

She landed on the other side of the desk and started to sprint to the door, hoping her speed could help her knock aside the remaining two robed men.

[they grab her]

Audrey struggled against their grasp, trying to break free. They marched her out of the room and into the hallway, where the bookish one nervously waited.

"Let me talk to her," he said, "If I can convince her to come quietly, we'll all have a much quieter ride back out to the Light."

The larger robed man looked at his companion and shrugged. Letting Audrey go and stepping back. Audrey swiftly kicked him in the shins as he backed away and tried to make another dash out to freedom. But just as suddenly as she had moved, she stopped, mid-step. She was frozen in place by an unseen force. She craned her eyes in her head to look around wildly for the source of the sudden constriction and tried to yell through clamped jaws. She heard a deep sigh from behind her and saw the bookish acolyte walk into view. He bent down to speak directly to her ear.

"I really didn't want to do that to you, its always terribly unpleasant for people. Look, I know you don't want to be here or for you to come with us but the Reverend is a powerful man. If you run he will hunt you down one way or another. He will punish you for defying him and make sure the people around you suffer as well. I'm not going to pretend this will be easy for you, but if you come quietly now, you can protect them." Audrey's gaze softened as she thought of Hawthorne muttering to herself in the other room and Lyra, obliviously tinkering in the courtyard out back. 

"If you truly are the Champion," he continued, "it also might be worth your while to find out what this is all about. I'm no expert, but you've shown you're faster and stronger than ordinary. I'd say you have some magic in your bloodline. And I can probably show you what that potential could mean for you."

He punctuated this last statement by conjuring a small ball of light into his palm and floating it in front of her eyes. She watched, entranced as it bubbled and lost shape before reforming into a small winged figure that rose slowly. 

He leaned back and asked loudly "Now, will you come with us? Blink once for yes, twice for no."

Audrey hesitated. She only had bad options here. She knew that with this constriction spell she was going no matter what. Screw it, she thought.

She blinked once.

"Good," spectacles said. Audrey felt the constriction spell leave her and she nearly fell over as she felt her regain control of her limbs. The large robed figure grabbed her arm and hauled her back up. She scoffed and shook him off before following spectacles down the hallway. They passed through the main doorway and stepped out into the street, where a well-worn but sturdy covered wagon sat outside. The side looked as if it had been painted once with small, flowing tendrils of gold and white, but had since been chipped away by the harsh weather of the desert. There was a door affixed to the back of the wagon where usually a flap would allow people to climb in and out with ease. Audrey figured this was to protect people from the blowing sand out in the Wastes. Leaning against the side was the Reverend as he scribbled in a small, red book. He looked up at their approach.

"Ah. Ready to go then, Champion?"

Audrey, still seething but momentarily quelled by the words of spectacles stared at him before nodding. She had nothing to say to this man, but she had to play along for now.

"Good. You shall travel in the back for the journey, there isn't enough space up front."

The large robed man circled to the back and opened the door for her, exposing a small, dark wagon-bed full of dry goods from the general store. Audrey hesitated before she climbed up onto the half-step leading into the back. As she stepped up she heard a voice from behind the fencing.

"Audrey?"

She turned and saw Lyra, clutching at the fence posts, staring with eyes wide.

"Lyra!" Audrey called, "They're taking me, I can't-" She felt the harsh grip of the large robed man on her arm again.

"AUDREY!" Lyra screamed and reached out, still stuck behind the fencing.

"LYRA! I'll come ba-" 

The large robed figure shoved her into the wagon and slammed the door shut, trapping her in the dark. Audrey was alone.
