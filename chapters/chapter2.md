Renard had led them back to the Wandering Wyvern pub that Audrey had passed on her way to the warehouse. The inside was shrouded in cream walls with golden accents and archways, far fancier than any other building she had passed in the mostly working-class textile district. The pub was just on the edge of the city center, as the downtown area met with the industrial periphery of Chantelle. It had an odd mix of polished, upper class snobbery contrasted with a rough furniture and worn upholstery. It felt like a place that was trying too hard to appear fancy, without the funds to back it up. They had picked a booth in the way back of the narrow pub, and Audrey put her back to the far wall so she could view the whole inside. A nervous habit she picked up from too many ambushes early in her career. As she settled into the booth, still holding the enormous cylinder, she glanced up at her new companion.
 
"So whats the deal with this place? Have you been here before?" Audrey said, observing the admittedly pretty rough looking clientele. She thought that the guy she had beaten up earlier certainly wouldn't be out of place in here.

Renard simply grinned at her question. "I scoped this place out a little earlier but I've never been in here before. Place just popped up about a month ago, its supposed to have some great liquor out of Duskeep."

"Huh. Duskeep is supposed to be a college town, I can believe it."

One of the barmaids walked over to the booth. She was a tall, half-elven woman with stark white hair and piercing blue eyes. She moved with a strange kind of grace to her, totally clashing with the rowdy atmosphere of the strange pub. She approached the booth and tossed her hair over her right shoulder and settled her eyes on Audrey.

"What can I get you two to drink?" she asked, addressing them both but staring directly at Audrey.

Renard responded first. "We'll take two ales, please," he said, slapping a few silver coins on the table. The barmaid picked them up and tucked them into her apron, turning back to Audrey. 

"Sound good to you, sugar?" she asked, expectantly.

"Uhh... actually can I get something nonalcoholic?" Audrey stuttered. She had never been in a bar before, but somehow she knew she didn't actually drink. Stupid amnesia.

The barmaid chuckled, "Sure. We've got a nice cider I can get you a mug of." She dropped two bar napkins on the table and walked back towards the bar, throwing a glance over her shoulder to look back at Audrey. Audrey felt herself blush and quickly broke eye contact to look back at Renard, who was snickering. Audrey pinched her leg, trying to get her face to calm down by focusing on anything except the cute barmaid.

"So whats your whole deal?" Renard asked, composing himself.

Audrey snorted. "My whole deal?"

Renard rolled his eyes. "Look, you seem like a strange kind of match for your line of work given how you handled that guy earlier. I was curious how you got to it." Renard asked, fiddling with the napkin on the table in front of him. He was probing for something here, she could feel it. But what the hell, they just watched a whole building burn together and violently quit their day jobs. She felt a connection here.

Audrey sighed. "To be honest, I don't really know. I can't remember any of my life before about three years ago. All I know about is that I was employed by Sarin and I'd been working for him a long time here in Chantelle."

This time, Renard snorted. "Well thats a load of horseshit because you're clearly from Rusken."

Audrey sat up straighter in the booth and snapped her eyes back to Renard. "What? How can you know that?"

At that moment the barmaid came back with their drinks, oblivious to the tension in the booth. She placed their drinks on the table and flicked her eyes back over to Audrey. "You need anything, just ask for Tal'drei at the bar, alright?"

Audrey blinked and muttered a quick thank you, still totally focused on what Renard just said. Rusken? She had always lived in Chantelle, as far as she knew. She was relatively sure Rusken was out east, close to the... Audrey gulped. The desert. The flaming building.

She barely noticed as Tal'drei rolled her eyes and left the two of them. As soon as she was out of earshot, Audrey leaned in towards Renard.
"Explain."

Renard continued to fold the napkin, as if paying her no mind. "Yeah, the way you put emphasis on hard R sounds and you drop your G's every once in a while. You have hints of that folksy rural drawl. I'd wager you grew up in Rusken, probably an orphan, maybe doing some kind of martial training or heavy lifting as labor when you got older." Renard said idly, now starting to fold the napkin into some animal. Maybe a dragon? Or a really strange goose?

Audrey leaned over the table and hissed at him. "Wait how can you tell all that? You don't even know me!"

Renard shrugged, still focused on the napkin. "You have some deep calluses on your hands and you're only like what, twenty-one? You'd have to have gotten those as some kind of teenager. As far as the orphan thing, Szet said your last name was Ward, right?"

"Yeah but what does that have to do with my parents?"

Renard looked up and gave her that smile again. "Last name Ward means you're a ward of the state, buddy. Your legal guardian was likely some kind of institution."

Audrey sighed. "I guess I should've known that about the last name huh." she leaned back into booth, her mind racing. What he was saying clicked into her mind like puzzle pieces, it all felt true. This was more information than she had ever been able to uncover about herself, and it all felt familiar. Like an old jacket she had left in the attic years ago but still fit perfectly. She felt a warm combination of contentment and excitement.

"Nah," Renard said, now unfolding the napkin and refolding it, "I wouldn't expect you to know that, you grew up pretty sheltered."

The warm feeling left immediately. "Alright, fuck off."

"I'm right and you know it!" Renard teased.

"No you're not, I'm not sheltered! I'm a thief and a thug for a criminal syndicate! How could I be sheltered??" Audrey said, raising her voice.
 
"First off I'm not going to tell you how to live your life but you might not want to yell that in the middle of a crowded pub." said Renard delicately.  

//this is dumb and I need to figure out a different way to do this besides a throwaway joke about criminal unions and socialism

Audrey looked around and sure enough the people in the booth ahead of them had turned to look at them with interest. One was a old dwarf with a gnarled looking face wrapped in a wild red beard, while the other was a small lizardfolk man who was twirling a knife in his lithe fingers. The dwarf grunted "What syndicate, missy?"

Audrey looked at Renard whose eyes had gone wide. "Uh. The uh. Sarin?" She said, trying to analyze how quickly she could grab Renard and run past those two, out of the bar.

The lizardfolk man let out a hissing laugh. "Oh those bastards are awful! You should work for the Trostengards, much better benefits." The dwarf nodded vigorously, "Yeah, you can't let those guys take advantage of someone as powerful as you, missy. You could crack their skulls wide open and they had better know it! Ha!"

Audrey was really confused. Were they giving her career advice? "Um. Thank you? I'll keep it in mind."

"No problem." hissed the lizardfolk man. Audrey looked back at Renard, who just shrugged. "Good advice." he said.

Audrey let out a nervous laugh as the other pair turned back to their drinks. "Okay. That was weird." she said, focusing back on Renard "What were we talking about?"

"How you were a sheltered child in Rusken." Renard said. 

"Tell me what you think you know."

"Well let me explain it this way. Okay so have you ever hitched a horse to a wagon?" 

"Sure, of course." Audrey said automatically.

"How do you know?" 

"Um," Audrey hesitated. How *did* she know? "I'm not sure, I just have a feeling I guess."

"Alright, well have you ever had sex?"

Audrey nearly choked on her drink. "*What*."

Renard laughed. "See? Sheltered. You said you don't drink and didn't notice the waitress looking you over at all."

"That doesn't. You can't," Audrey stuttered. She wanted to know more about herself but this was stuff she didn't want other people to know about her.

Renard grinned at her discomfort and then scratched his chin, considering something. Finally he said "You know, I bet theres a religious connection there."

Audrey took a gulp of her chocolate to calm herself down. Sex, alcohol, and women? Not exactly her strong suit. A religious connection, though? She can handle that. 

"How do you mean?" She asked.

Renard took a second and just looked her up and down. He shrugged "Honestly I don't know. Just a hunch. But my hunches are usually right."

"How can you tell so much about me like this? I've been trying to figure out my past for years, and you've just told me more in one night than I've found ever."

Renard looked sheepish and he spread his hands open on the table.

"Well, I have to confess thats because I have some secrets here too. I'm not actually a thief-for-hire, I'm a private investigator." 

Audrey sat up straighter. She hadn't expected that. She cocked her eyebrow at him and slowly tightened her grip on the cylinder still sitting in the booth beside her.

"Before you freak out, I'm not investigating you specifically." He leaned down to the table and lowered his voice. "How much have you heard about the string of arsons in the city?"

"Isn't that us? Sarin's crew?"

Renard shook his head. "I'm not so sure. You guys fall into the general pattern of organized crime in the city, but it might be involved. There's been a discrepancy. Someone's been burning religious sites. Churches, temples, some mausoleums. Its strange because there's no real connection between the sites besides the general spirituality of the spaces, but whoever is doing it is covering their tracks pretty well. Almost no evidence, because of the burn. Nothing taken. Nobody injured. Except the witnesses, well I guess they're not really witnesses anymore. They all got blasted with a powerful memory charm."

"Memory charm." Audrey murmured. All of a sudden her head started to ache. It was as if an enormous weight had settled over her mind and began to push. Hard. Suddenly she was thinking about the plants she had left in her apartment. Did she water them before she left? She shook her head. Focus, she thought, shaking her head.

"Thats why the police brought me on." Renard said, slowly. "Memory charms are my specialty." He then nodded to her. "Thats why you caught my eye, Ward."

"Memory charms." Audrey repeated. The pain began to intensify. Like the thing in her mind had begun to squeeze. Her mind started to drift again but she tugged herself back into the moment.

"I'd heard about an amnesiac bruiser powerhouse connected to some petty theft, but I didn't think I'd encounter anything like this." Renard continued. "It was mostly a coincidence that I ended up on your gig tonight, I was looking into Sarin's crew as a possible connection, but I wasn't sure if our paths would cross. But now that they have, I'd wager you're connected here."

Audrey winced. Her head was pounding. "Connected?" she asked.

Renard had turned back to folding his napkin. He was rapidly folding now, and the goose had morphed into a more blocky shape. "Absolutely. Your memories are blocked, you're some kind of light-based demigod, and your crew is currently contracted out to steal that big weird cylinder, which is some kind of magical artifact." 

"And how do you know that?" Audrey asked, trying to focus despite the pain.

Renard pointed at the cylinder and raised an eyebrow. The intricate carvings had begun to glow faintly with a sinister, purple light. Audrey immediately grabbed her hand back from it. The pain and fog in her brain disappeared almost instantaneously. 

"Gods I thought my head was going to explode. That thing was clouding my brain, making it hard to think straight."

"Well thats a bad sign for whatever that thing is." Renard frowned.

Audrey shook her head to clear her thoughts. "So you think I got blasted with a memory charm, and I'm involved in this thing somehow?"

"Yep. If I were a betting man, I'd say you're in the throes of a nasty memory charm, which does *not* want to give up based on how long it took your brain to come 'round to that idea."

"Yeah, it was almost like the charm was resisting me from realizing it was there... As you were talking about it my head just kept pounding and drifting away."

"Huh," Renard scratched his chin again. "Sometimes theres some resistance built into these kinds of charms, but they can't ever really control your mind, just block things from surfacing."

Audrey looked down at the cylinder again, which had gone dark and was benignly sitting on the booth. "It might have been the cylinder, making it more powerful somehow."

"What is that thing supposed to be anyways? They never told me what we were stealing, just where it was going."

Audrey held the artifact in her hands and hefted it slightly. It didn't begin to glow again, but she felt a stirring inside of herself as she concentrated on it. 

"The dossier just called it a 'conduit', I figured we were picking up industrial equipment but this was certainly a surprise. I thought this was a simple cash grab, steal something expensive and ransom it back. Although, I highly doubt that's what the plan was for this thing."

Renard nodded. "I got wind of this gig from a contact of mine just outside the city. This was a subcontract, someone hired Sarin to steal this thing for them. I got myself on the job because I got a tip our arsonist was the buyer."

Audrey looked up at him in alarm. "You mean that your memory charm blasting, church burning maniac wants this thing?"

Renard stared back at Audrey with an intensity she had yet to see from the gnome. He had stopped fiddling with the napkin and was totally focused on her. "Yep. And based on the charm-work going on in your head, there are enough similarities to the victims that I'd say he was the one who blasted you three years ago. This can't be a coincidence. I think we can help each other out here."

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "How so?" 

"Well like I said, I specialize in memory charms, specifically breaking them. And you specialize in punching people which I am at a distinct physical disadvantage with accomplishing. Between the two of us I think we can blow this case wide open and probably figure out what happened to you."

Audrey stared into the bottom of her mug. It would be so easy to walk away right now. Arsons and memory charms was more than she had bargained for tonight, but at the same time she felt a tug in her gut towards this whole plot. Renard was right, she could feel she was connected to this in some way. The fire from before flashed in her mind. She was sick of running around in the shadows. Sick of hating herself for crimes she had no context for. She had burned down that building in the desert, but she had no clue why. Now she knew she had a history, she had a hometown. She might not have had parents as an orphan, but surely there were people that cared about her somewhere? If she walked away now, she could never know what her life had been. She raised her head, and met Renard's eyes. For the first time in a long time, she had a lifeline. A connection. A friend. 

Renard stuck out his hand, "Partners?"

Audrey stared at it. She was sick of being alone. She grabbed his hand and matched his easy grin. "Partners. So whats our move here?"

Renard smiled. "Well we know that our arsonist bankrolled our heist earlier. We know he wants the cylinder. And we know where he's going to be tonight."

Audrey looked at him in confusion. "We do?"

"Where were we supposed to drop off the cylinder with Szet?"

Her eyes widened. "The old cathedral..."

Renard finally uncupped his hands and inside was a tiny, paper likeness of the enormous building at the center of the city. The napkin didn't do justice to its huge, jagged towers and ancient glass windows. They needed to break into the Cathedral of Light.

Audrey grabbed the cylinder and stood up. "Well lets get going then." She started to move and make her way to the door but Renard grabbed her arm.

"Actually, I know a shortcut." Renard said, grinning again. He pointed to a huge wooden door behind the bar. "That leads down into the cellar of this building which connects with an underground smuggler's route that passes straight under the Cathedral."

"Great! How do we get in?"

"Well, I was going to try to sweet talk our waitress, but I think you're much more her speed."

"WHAT? No I can't do that. I have no idea how to talk to women!"

Renard got up from his seat and started dragging her towards the bar. "How hard can it be? You're a woman, just say stuff you'd think was interesting."

Audrey tried to dig her heels in but the gnome was surprisingly strong, "Ren, this is a terrible idea."

Renard gave her a final shove towards the bar as he called out to her "C'mon whats the worst that could happen?"
